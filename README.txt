Jena Patcher
------------

Jena patcher is just a small (unofficial and unsupported) bash script to
automate the application of a patch to Jena (not yet), ARQ and/or TDB and
to publish Maven SNAPSHOTs artifacts in your local repository or on the 
Talis one: http://oss.talisplatform.com/content/repositories/talis-snapshots/

Hope this helps.
